      <description>Part 2 of my blog chain Beyond Code. Start here.
 The A Future of Programming There are so many directions to explore to democratize programming. It&amp;rsquo;s useful to be opinionated, make some choices upfront, and shrink the solution space a bit. You might disagree with my choices here, and that&amp;rsquo;s ok. I write them down so we can find out quickly. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean other directions are wrong or less promising, this is just the direction I am headed.</description>

      <description>Part 1 of my blog chain Beyond Code.
At the end of 2016, after I had left Apple, and half-way into a year of traveling, I thought about what I wanted to tackle next and wrote down1 some big ideas that got me excited. As part of a larger document I wrote:
 Make Developing Software Accessible to Everyone
aka &amp;ldquo;Fix software development&amp;rdquo;
A lot has changed in software development over the last fifty years, but we still struggle with the same complexities.</description>
