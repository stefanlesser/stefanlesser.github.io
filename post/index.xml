      <description>Structure and Behavior In 2018 I wrote a vision document for a start-up I was planning to found shortly after (spoiler: I chose to not become a founder and am now an investor instead).

      <description>I wanted to write a thoughtful article in response to Dominik Wagner&#39;s &amp;ldquo;On my misalignment with Apple&#39;s love affair with Swift&amp;rdquo;.
